This idea originally occurred to me about a decade ago while at a local mini-rave in Springfield, MO. Yeah, Springfield. Don't ask. Anyway...

Watching the D.J. spin her records up in on her magic DJ pedestal, I observed the inevitable disconnect between a director of crowds and the crowd so directed when the conductor is isolated from her charges. A shaman doesn't watch from the sidelines and shout instructions to his tribespeople, he's right there waving his arms and hollering around the fire with the rest of those bastards. So why should it be so different in the modern age?

So, the basic idea is to turn the human body into an electronically assisted musical instrument.

Physical build: strap acceleration sensors to each major body point, put a chording keyboard in each hand, and don a HUD.

Prep work: create a library of audio samples.

Dance, motherfucker: Use the chording keyboard to map samples to various body movements, and use the rhythm of your body to create that music and transfer your energy to the crowd at the same time.

Seems pretty keen.
